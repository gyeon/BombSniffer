Controllers:

  - consider using handlebars in your index, so you don't have to append & create a result every time
  - then in your controllers, you can just have a function to render the data 
  - then in your app.js, just call the function?


  - don't know if this is worth doing, but in actors controller  having a results model might work better, so for each response.results you can just make a new movie without having to declare variables for every time

  - in appendData(), maybe the moneyString bit could be in a different function? it looks like it is called in both controllers so could just have one function that does that for both

app.js

  - what's happening in here? if you're creating something, maybe this can go in the controller
    var tag = document.createElement('script');
    tag.src = "https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api";
    var firstScriptTag = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
    firstScriptTag.parentNode.insertBefore(tag, firstScriptTag);
      - ah, but ok, i see what you did there.
